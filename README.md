## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I practiced using CSS variables for color management, Flexbox for layout, and media queries for responsive design. I also improved my understanding of semantic HTML and accessibility.

```html
<button>
  <img loading="async" src="images/icon-cart.svg" alt="Cart icon" />
  Add to Cart
</button>
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design, CSS Grid, and accessibility. I also aim to explore more advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript for interactive components.
